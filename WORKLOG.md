## 2026-07-29T14:20:00+01:00 · Claude · Reviewed A.1–A.3; independently verified; approved
- **Did:** Full review of the scaffold + catalogue + product read API against `02`–`04`. Re-ran `go vet ./...` (clean), `go build ./...` (clean), `go test ./...` (health + products pass). Read migrations, code-generated seed, and product model/service/handler/routes.
- **State:** Approved — no changes needed. The three design-token findings I raised earlier (Georgia-serif display font, missing champagne `#e0cf9c`, thin/inverted type scale) were **already resolved by Codex in `576ee77`** before I looked, so no fix commit was warranted. Confirmed golden invariants hold: money is integer `priceKobo` (₦850,000 → `85000000`), `R2Key` hidden from JSON, inputs validated pre-DB, active-only reads, stable error envelopes, `has_sizes` RTW/bespoke split intact.
- **Next:** Unchanged — A.4 storefront shell awaits user authorization. Handing the baton back to Codex.
- **Blockers:** None new. Client deliverables still gate later steps.

## 2026-07-29T14:01:01+01:00 · Codex · Milestone A.3 product read API completed
- **Did:** Added typed product models, active-only PostgreSQL repository queries, validated service filters, R2 image URL mapping, JSON handlers, and routes for product listing/search/detail.
- **State:** Go tests, vet, and binary build pass. Live API checks return 27 products (17 bespoke, 10 RTW), correct combined filters/details, literal wildcard search, stable 400/404 errors, CORS, and integer-kobo prices; Nuxt SSR remains connected.
- **Next:** Wait for approval, then begin A.4 storefront shell components only.
- **Blockers:** None for A.4; real product photography remains a later client dependency.

## 2026-07-29T13:45:00+01:00 · Codex · Milestone A.2 migrations and catalogue seed completed
- **Did:** Added embedded up/down migrations for products, images, settings, and delivery zones; generated a validated 27-product seed directly from `product-data.js`; integrated automatic migration before API startup.
- **State:** Go tests and the API binary build pass, seed generation is deterministic, PostgreSQL is clean at migration version 2, and a second startup preserved 27 unique products (17 bespoke, 10 RTW) with integer-kobo prices. API health remains HTTP 200.
- **Next:** Wait for approval, then begin A.3 product read endpoints only.
- **Blockers:** None for A.3; image keys, delivery fees, and client settings remain pending for later steps.

## 2026-07-29T13:22:06+01:00 · Codex · Core design tokens corrected before A.2
- **Did:** Replaced the serif display fallback with self-hosted Jost Variable, normalized the type scale through a 60px display token, and added the approved champagne, bright-gold, and taupe palette values.
- **State:** Nuxt typecheck/build pass; the live stylesheet serves the corrected tokens and local font assets. The function/computed-property walkthrough-comment rule is now durable in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Next:** Wait for approval, then begin A.2 migrations and catalogue seed only.
- **Blockers:** None for A.2; licensed Gilmer remains a pre-launch client decision.

## 2026-07-29T12:33:10+01:00 · Codex · Frontend styling migrated to modular SCSS
- **Did:** Replaced the plain CSS entry with SCSS design-system tokens, breakpoint mixins, globals, and a foundation-page partial; added Nuxt preprocessing and `sass-embedded`.
- **State:** No plain CSS source remains. Nuxt typecheck/build and live SCSS compilation pass; existing page output and service connectivity are preserved.
- **Next:** Wait for approval, then begin A.2 migrations and catalogue seed only.
- **Blockers:** None for A.2.

## 2026-07-29T12:20:25+01:00 · Codex · Milestone A.1 scaffold completed and verified
- **Did:** Initialized and renamed the repository to `oyecouture`; added PostgreSQL 16 Compose, complete `.env.example`, Go API `/healthz`, and a strictly typed Nuxt 3 client that consumes it.
- **State:** PostgreSQL, API, and web dev services are running. Go tests/build and Nuxt typecheck/build pass; runtime health and SSR both report all services connected.
- **Next:** Wait for approval, then begin A.2 migrations and catalogue seed only.
- **Blockers:** None for A.2. Later client credentials/content remain pending as listed in `HANDOFF-STATE.md`.

## 2026-07-29 · Claude · Handoff package + collaboration kit created
- **Did:** Wrote the numbered handoff docs `00`–`06`, `catalogue/` (product-data.js + CATALOGUE.md), copied `design-source/` (7 design files + HOW-TO-VIEW) and `reference-docs/` (PRD + QUOTATION). Added this collaboration kit: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOFF-STATE.md`, `WORKLOG.md`.
- **State:** Planning complete. No code yet. First 40% milestone paid; build authorized.
- **Next:** Milestone A, step A.1 — scaffold the repo (Nuxt 3 + Go + Postgres) and get both dev servers talking; copy the four baton files to the new repo root. See `HANDOFF-STATE.md`.
- **Blockers:** None for A.1. Client deliverables (Nomba creds, WhatsApp number, delivery fees, photos, care-page copy, DNS) gate later steps — chase them.
